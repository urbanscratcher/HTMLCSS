                <h2>Who is Jane Jacobs?</h2>
                <p>Jane Jacobs(4 May 1916 – 25 April 2006) was an American-Canadian journalist, author, and activist who influenced urban studies, sociology, and economics. Her book The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961) argued that urban renewal/slum
                    clearance did not respect the needs of city-dwellers. The book introduced ground-breaking ideas about how cities function, evolve and fail. The impact of Jane Jacobs's observation, activism, and writing has led to a 'planning blueprint'
                    for generations of architects, planners, politicians and activists to practice.</p>
                <p>Jacobs organized grassroots efforts to protect neighborhoods from urban renewal/slum clearance, in particular Robert Moses' plans to overhaul her own Greenwich Village neighborhood. She was instrumental in the eventual cancellation of
                    the Lower Manhattan Expressway, which would have passed directly through SoHo, Manhattan and Little Italy, Manhattan. She was arrested in 1968 for inciting a crowd at a public hearing on that project. After moving to Toronto in 1968,
                    she joined the opposition to the Spadina Expressway and the associated network of expressways in Toronto planned, and under construction.</p>
                <p>Jacobs saw cities as integrated systems that had their own logic and dynamism which would change over time according to how they were used. With an eye for detail, she wrote eloquently about sidewalks, parks, retail design and self-organization.
                    She promoted higher density in cities, short blocks, local economies and mixed uses. Jacobs helped derail the car-centered approach to urban planning in both New York and Toronto, invigorating neighborhood activism by helping stop
                    the expansion of expressways and roads.</p>
                <p>As a mother and a writer who criticized experts in the male-dominated field of urban planning, Jacobs endured scorn from established figures. She was described as a housewife first, as she did not in fact have a college degree or any formal
                    training in urban planning; in consequence, her lack of credentials was seized upon as grounds for criticism.</p>
                <p>A firm believer in the importance of local residents having input on how their neighborhoods develop, Jacobs encouraged people to familiarize themselves with the places where they live, work, and play.</p>

            <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/17285.Jane_Jacobs">“Under the seeming disorder of the old city, wherever the old city is working successfully, is a marvelous order for maintaining the safety of the streets and the freedom of the city. It is a complex order. Its essence is intricacy of sidewalk
                use, bringing with it a constant succession of eyes. This order is all composed of movement and change, and although it is life, not art, we may fancifully call it the art form of the city and liken it to the dance — not to a simple-minded
                precision dance with everyone kicking up at the same time, twirling in unison and bowing off en masse, but to an intricate ballet in which the individual dancers and ensembles all have distinctive parts which miraculously reinforce each
                other and compose an orderly whole. The ballet of the good city sidewalk never repeats itself from place to place, and in any once place is always replete with new improvisations.” <br /><span style="display: inline-block; width: 100%; text-align: right; margin-top: 0.8rem">― Jane Jacobs, The Death and Life of Great American Cities</span></blockquote>
